# Luzifer / twitch-bot

Twitch-Bot is intended as an alternative to having a bot managed by Streamlabs or Streamelements and therefore having more control over it, the availability and how it works.

At the moment it is a work-in-progress and does not yet implment all features it shall in the future.
