Get started with the installation of the Twitch-Bot and get to the point you do have a working bot inside your channel.

The majority of this sections assumes you are working on a **Linux Server** with direct internet access. If you are doing your setup on another system you might need to adapt steps or even replace them. The basic setup should be the same but some steps will differ.

If you don't have a server yet you could get a [Hetzner Cloud server (referral link)](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=843sgmhTGlwR) for little more than 5 Euro per month which is perfectly capable to drive your bot!

Installing the bot on your **local computer** is not advisable as your bot will miss events occurring when you're offline / your computer is turned off. Also it will suffer from instabilities in your local internet connection as datacenter-connections are typically way more stable than your local domestical internet connection. (Though it is possible to use the bot on your local computer, I'd just advice against it.)
